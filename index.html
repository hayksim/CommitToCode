		<h1>Commit to Code</h1>
		<p>Commitment and hard work are the only path to success.</p>
	</div>	<br><br>

		<h3>Day 1</h3>
		<p>Started where I left from at html/css and bootstrap. Finished the former and got "Create a Bootstrap Headline" lesson. Excited to see what's coming next.</p>
		<p>I thought I could go to bed but the thought of not being able to finish bootstrap kept me going. And there I am about to start jQuery. Great day.</p>
	</div><br>
	<div>
		<h3>Day 2</h3>
		<p>Started with jQuery. it's pretty fun to work with. Finally getting to understand what's going on and learning to correctly read the code.</p>
		<p>Could not go more than 7 lessons due to busy schedule. </p>
	</div><br>
	<div>
		<h3>Day 3</h3>
		<p>Continue where I left of yesterday. Will try to do at least 60min of coding today.</p>
		<p>Got to my first challange to builing a "Tribute Page". Checked the attached video and registered at codePen.io website. I am going to pick "medicine" as a theme and do some research there.</p>
	</div><br>

		<h3>Day 4 (Tirbute page)</h3>
		<p>I have started to work on my Tribute page. I decided to write about a French doctor oncologist who revolutionized surgery techniques and dramatically improved surgery survival. I got his book while I was studying for my med school back in days. The book was from late 19th century. Amazing experience while reading that. Working on the timeline now from a research article I found online. I will link that to the web page. </p>
		<p>I will be working on SublimeText and then will copy it into CodePen.</p>
	</div><br>
	<div>
		<h3>Day 5 (Tribute page)</h3>
		<p>Did a lot of research on the doctor I am writing about. There is not much information in english. I was able to find a research article and I am planning to include that, plus wikipedia website (which is in French) as additional link.</p>
		
		<h3>Day 6 (Tribute page)</h3>
		<p>After three days of searching and asking I finished my first web page. Big step for me considering how much time was I trying to dedicate for buiding a webpage during the past year. There was never enough time for that. <br>
		It turned out I was only lacking commitment. That was the key I was looking for.<br>
		I am going to review my code carefully before copying it into codepen. Attention to details is what's matters.
		</p>
		<p>Troubleshooting: so as I pasted my project from SublimeText to codepen I encountered some issues. 
		Problem: First of I had an image that had to be linked to the codepan page. After googling for a while I found a forum topic discussing linking it to GitHub account, that seemed to be the fastest.</p>
		<p>Solution: Upload your project files into GitHub account (create a new repository), go the image of interest, open it, right click on the image and choose <b>Inspect</b>. Then go to <b>Sources</b>, right click on the image and choose <b>Copy image as Data URI</b>. After that paste the link into your codepen src of the image (random numbers and letters starting with data:image/ ).</p>
		<p>Problem: offset in bootstrap did not work.</p>
		<p>Solution: when working in SublimeText I used bootstrap 3.6. After some research I found out that bootstrap 4 is using the offset differently. Instead of col-*-offset-number it should be offset-*-number. Or .img-responsive is now .img-fluid. Will watch some videos and do some reading on what has changed in Bootstrap 4.</p>
