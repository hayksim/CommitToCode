		<h3>Day 1</h3>
		<p>Started where I left from at html/css and bootstrap. Finished the former and got "Create a Bootstrap Headline" lesson. Excited to see what's coming next.</p>
		<p>I thought I could go to bed but the thought of not being able to finish bootstrap kept me going. And there I am about to start jQuery. Great day.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Day 2</h3>
		<p>Started with jQuery. it's pretty fun to work with. Finally getting to understand what's going on and learning to correctly read the code.</p>
		<p>Could not go more than 7 lessons due to busy schedule. </p>
	</div><br>
	<div>
		<h3>Day 3</h3>
		<p>Continue where I left of yesterday. Will try to do at least 60min of coding today.</p>
