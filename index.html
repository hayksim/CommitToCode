		<h1>Commit to Code</h1>
		<p>Commitment and hard work are the only path to success.</p>

		<h3>Day 1</h3>
		<p>Started where I left from at html/css and bootstrap. Finished the former and got "Create a Bootstrap Headline" lesson. Excited to see what's coming next.</p>
		<p>I thought I could go to bed but the thought of not being able to finish bootstrap kept me going. And there I am about to start jQuery. Great day.</p>
	</div><br>
	<div>
		<h3>Day 2</h3>
		<p>Started with jQuery. it's pretty fun to work with. Finally getting to understand what's going on and learning to correctly read the code.</p>
		<p>Could not go more than 7 lessons due to busy schedule. </p>
	</div><br>
	<div>
		<h3>Day 3</h3>
		<p>Continue where I left of yesterday. Will try to do at least 60min of coding today.</p>
		<p>Got to my first challange to builing a "Tribute Page". Checked the attached video and registered at codePen.io website. I am going to pick "medicine" for my page.</p>
	</div><br>	
	<div>
		<h3>Day 4</h3>
		<p>I have started to work on my Tribute page. I decided to write about a French doctor oncologist who revolutionized surgery techniques and dramatically improved surgery survival. I got his book while I was studying for my med school back in days. The book was from late 19th century. Amazing experience while reading that. Working on the timeline now from a research article I found online. I will link that to the web page. </p>
