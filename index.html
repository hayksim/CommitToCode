		<h3>Day 1</h3>
		<p>Started where I left from at html/css and bootstrap. Finished the former and got "Create a Bootstrap Headline" lesson. Excited to see what's coming next.</p>
		<p>I thought I could go to bed but the thought of not being able to finish bootstrap kept me going. And there I am about to start jQuery. Great day.</p>
	</div><br>
	<div>
		
		<h3>Day 2</h3>
		<p>Started with jQuery. it's pretty fun to work with. Finally getting to understand what's going on and learning to correctly read the code.</p>
		<p>Could not go more than 7 lessons due to busy schedule. </p>
	</div><br>

	<div>
		<h3>Day 3</h3>
		<p>Continue where I left of yesterday. Will try to do at least 60min of coding today.</p>
		<p>Got to my first challange to builing a "Tribute Page". Checked the attached video and registered at codePen.io website. I am going to pick "medicine" as a theme and do some research there.</p>
	</div><br>

		<h3>Day 4 (Tirbute page)</h3>
		<p>I have started to work on my Tribute page. I decided to write about a French doctor oncologist who revolutionized surgery techniques and dramatically improved surgery survival. I got his book while I was studying for my med school back in days. The book was from late 19th century. Amazing experience while reading that. Working on the timeline now from a research article I found online. I will link that to the web page. </p>
		<p>I will be working on SublimeText and then will copy it into CodePen.</p>
	</div><br>
		
	<div>
		<h3>Day 5 (Tribute page)</h3>
		<p>Did a lot of research on the doctor I am writing about. There is not much information in english. I was able to find a research article and I am planning to include that, plus wikipedia website (which is in French) as additional link.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<h3>Day 6 (Tribute page)</h3>
		<p>After three days of searching and asking I finished my first web page. Big step for me considering how much time was I trying to dedicate for buiding a webpage during the past year. There was never enough time for that. <br>
		It turned out I was only lacking commitment. That was the key I was looking for.<br>
		I am going to review my code carefully before copying it into codepen. Attention to details is what's matters.
		</p>
		<p>Troubleshooting: so as I pasted my project from SublimeText to codepen I encountered some issues. 
		Problem: First of I had an image that had to be linked to the codepan page. After googling for a while I found a forum topic discussing linking it to GitHub account, that seemed to be the fastest.</p>
		<p>Solution: Upload your project files into GitHub account (create a new repository), go the image of interest, open it, right click on the image and choose <b>Inspect</b>. Then go to <b>Sources</b>, right click on the image and choose <b>Copy image as Data URI</b>. After that paste the link into your codepen src of the image (random numbers and letters starting with data:image/ ).</p>
		<p>Problem: offset in bootstrap did not work.</p>
		<p>Solution: when working in SublimeText I used bootstrap 3.6. After some research I found out that bootstrap 4 is using the offset differently. Instead of col-*-offset-number it should be offset-*-number. Or .img-responsive is now .img-fluid. Will watch some videos and do some reading on what has changed in Bootstrap 4.</p>
		<p>Before uploading the results I double-checked the text in microsoft word for errors in text (found two).</p>
		<h3>Day 2</h3>
			<p>Started with jQuery. it's pretty fun to work with. Finally getting to understand what's going on and learning to correctly read the code.</p>
			<p>Could not go more than 7 lessons due to busy schedule. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3>Day 7</h3>
			<p>Started to sketch my portfolio page on a paper. I will go with one page website, will try to make it simple and not too busy. Will start my coding with reading from w3 school.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3>Day 8</h3>
			<p>Did a lot of reasearch on how to choose colors for your websites. Founds a good link that helped me a lot. <br> Next I found another link for free high resolution images that might be useful for my portfolio website. Or give some perspective of what am I looing for and what better ways are there to express how I feel for my website.<p>
			<p>Finally I put together html and css files with a cover image (might change it later) and will go with one page website using bootstrap 4.0. I will start coding the html part this two days and watch bootstrap tutorials. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3>Day 9</h3>
			<p>Spend about an hour searching for images for my portfolio project. Then started coding the navbar and main cover with some text and links to my linkedin and twitter accounts. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3>Day 10</h3>
			<p>I have finished coding cover page. Will need to do some minor adjustments, like adding a three line menu for phone screens. <br>
			Continued coding of the main (projects) page and currently using cards assimetrically aligned to discplay current/future projects. So far it looks good.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3>Day 11</h3>
			<p>Continue working on my portfolio page. Figured out the cards section, although will do some reading for XS screen sizes as cards are too big when scaling down. Added scaling effect when hovering over the cards - looks cool. CSS is amazing.<br>
			Next stop is footer with a small contact information. I have added a background image. Will try to use it when testing parallax style coding.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div>
			<h3>Day 12</h3>
			<p>Onto my day 12 of the 100 days of coding challange. <br>
			I played with cards some more and added them into groups, which made the work much easier, since the sizes became the same. Did more reading on forms and will apply one to my page in the footer section. Also decided not to use parallax technique since want to get a better understanding of JS before jumping into it. Don't want to just copy and paste the code.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div>
			<h3>Day 13</h3>
			<p>Currently working on forms section and trying to position it so that it does not drop off the cover image. Getting some understanding of absolue and relative positioning. Finally could arrange footer appropriately. Still have issues when I resize the window to xs size - form goes down the bottom line of the footer image.<br>
			Got into media queries in CSS, so much fun to work with those. I am enjoying the learning process, something new every day. Planning to get rid of nav bar and just have three nice looking buttons.</p>
		</div>
			
		<h3>Day 14</h3>
			<p>Although it is taking me longer than expected with 1-1.5 hours of coding per day (I wish I could dedicate more hours at this point) I am learning a lot as I go - that is the whole purpuse after all, right? <br>
			I think my code is getting better as I use more and more tools to reach the goals I set for my portfolio. Now I only have to add fonts to my page and will upload it soon. <br>
			At the same time I am watching videos and reading online about git/github since I will need that a lot and very soon.</p>
		</div>
			
		<h3>Day 15</h3>
			<p>Today I have started to work on making the navigation bar responsive. Having some trouble with chrome and safari displaying bootstrap 4 alpha 6 responsive (toggleable) navbar. Doing some reading and searching for solutions. <br>
		I have decided to create a seperate navbar and make it visible for sm and smaller screens with media queries.</p>
